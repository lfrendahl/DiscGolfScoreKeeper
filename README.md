# Disc Golf Score Keeper

### This score card allows you add players and keep track of their score in a golf like fashion. Players start with a score of 0 and then strokes can be added or removed depending on their play. The players will automatically sorted by lowest score first to show up-to-date rankings.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Heroku

This CRUD application works with Heroku and MongoDB to allow users to add and delete names and update scores. CSS flex box and tables are used for the creation of the score card. Font Awesome was used for the add and subtract buttons and the trash can.

## Optimization Plan
Future plans for the site would be to build out the score card so that it is set up for 18 holes. With the addition of user authentification, users can track their own scores, which they submit by hole, but could also view a group score cards. This would allow current standings, but also individual scores that can be saved with location data so that users can historially review their data on which specific courses or holes they need to practice more.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned about working with Heroku and linking my github repository for automatic deployement. I also chose to structure the score card as a table to practice using this organizational layout.
